Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to install wq is via the [Python Package Index].  Any of [wq.app], [wq.db], or [wq.io] can be installed separately, or all three can be installed by simply installing the **wq** metapackage.  Either easy_install or pip should work.  wq currently only supports Python 2.7, though it will support Python 3 in the [near future].

```bash
pip install wq
```
## Using wq.db and wq.app

If you are using wq.app and wq.db together, you may find it useful to take advantage of the [Django wq template] available on GitHub and via the `wq-start` command.  You will need a WGSI-capable webserver like [Apache], and a database to host the application.  In theory any Django-supported database will work, but wq.db is optimized for use with [PostgreSQL] and [PostGIS].  You should be able to use something like the following to start a new wq-based Django project.

### On Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1 python-pip python-psycopg2 nodejs-legacy
sudo pip install wq

export PROJECTSDIR=/path/to/projects #e.g. /var/www
export PROJECTNAME=myproject

# Create project directory from wq template
cd $PROJECTSDIR
wq-start $PROJECTNAME
cd $PROJECTNAME
chmod +x deploy.sh db/manage.py
./deploy.sh 0.0.1 # generates htdocs folder via wq build

# Create database
(edit /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf and/or pg_ident.conf to set permissions)
createuser -d -e -E -l -P -r -s $PROJECTNAME
createdb -Upostgres -O$PROJECTNAME $PROJECTNAME
psql -Upostgres $PROJECTNAME -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

# Install database tables
(edit db/$PROJECTNAME/local_settings.py with database info, if different than above)
cd db/
chmod +x manage.py

#fix a bug

#sync database
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py migrate

# Configure and restart Apache
(edit conf/$PROJECTNAME.conf with correct domain name)
sudo ln -s $PROJECTSDIR/$PROJECTNAME/conf/$PROJECTNAME.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo a2enmod wsgi
sudo a2ensite $PROJECTNAME
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### On Windows
wq.db works best in a Linux environment, but should work fine on Windows.  Please leave a comment at [wq/wq#11] if you would like the setup process for Windows (or other operating systems) to be documented.

## Using only wq.app

If you are only interested in using wq.app, you can run `pip install wq.app` or simply download the [latest release] directly from GitHub.  You will likely want to set up your project with the following layout (inspired by [volo]):
```bash
project/
  js/
    lib -> /path/to/wq.app/js
    myapp/
      main.js
    myapp.js
  css/
    lib -> /path/to/wq.app/css
    myapp.css
  images/
  templates/
  index.html
  app.build.json
```

The typical workflow is to copy or link to wq.app's `js` folder from your app's `js/lib` folder and similarly for css.  Note that wq.app currently comes bundled with all of its [JavaScript dependencies] vendored in.  So, for many applications, you should be able to use wq.app's `js` folder directly as your `js/lib/` folder.  If you have other dependencies, or want to use different versions of the vendored apps, create your `js/lib/` folder first, and link to wq.app's [js/wq] folder from your `js/lib/wq`.  In either case, [wq init] can do the linking automatically.

### On Ubuntu
```bash
cd /path/to/my/project
wq init

# Or
ln -s /path/to/wq/app/js /path/to/my/project/js/lib
ln -s /path/to/wq/app/css /path/to/my/project/css/lib
```
### On Windows
As Python 2.7 on Windows does not support symbolic links, `wq init` will not work.  You can copy the folder wq/app/js into your project's js folder and rename it to "lib".  Similarly, copy wq/app/css into your project's css folder and rename it to "lib".

### Utilizing wq.app
Once you have done this you should be able to reference wq.app's modules from your JavaScript code:
```javascript
// myapp/mymodule.js
define(['wq/chart'], function(chart) {
// do something
});
```
See the [wq.app module list] for available modules, and the [build docs] for information about available build options.
